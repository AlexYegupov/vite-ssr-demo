# Static Site Generation for React Router 7

Successfully implemented static site generation for React Router 7 project:

1. **Configuration**: Set `ssr: true` and `prerender: ["/", "/mypage"]` in react-router.config.ts
2. **Removed dynamic loader**: Removed Cloudflare environment dependency from home route
3. **Made props optional**: Updated Welcome component to have optional message prop with default value
4. **Created build script**: Created scripts/build-static.mjs that:
   - Runs React Router build
   - Copies client assets to build/static
   - Generates index.html for home page
   - Generates mypage/index.html for mypage route
   - Includes proper CSS and JS references
5. **Added npm scripts**:
   - `npm run build:static` - Builds the static site
   - `npm run serve:static` - Serves the static site locally

The static site is generated in build/static/ directory with proper file structure for deployment to any static hosting service.
