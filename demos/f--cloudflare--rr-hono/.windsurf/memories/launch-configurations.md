# VS Code Launch Configurations

Created comprehensive VS Code launch configurations for debugging the Cloudflare Workers React SSR project:

1. **Run React Router Dev** - For frontend development
2. **Run Wrangler Dev** - For testing the full application as it would run on Cloudflare
3. **Debug Wrangler Dev** - For debugging server-side code
4. **Debug Browser** - For debugging client-side code
5. **Debug Full Stack** - For comprehensive debugging of both server and client code

Also synchronized package.json scripts with the launch configurations to provide consistent development experience.
